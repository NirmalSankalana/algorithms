A cybercriminal is orchestrating an attack on the central bank's data server. In response, a group
of skilled engineers has been mobilized to prevent the breach. The central bank's network
comprises numerous interconnected computers, forming a complex web of communication
pathways. You can model this communication network as a graph, where each computer serves
as a vertex and the connections between them are represented as edges. Note that, all the
connections are bidirectional.
Given a graph (that defines a computer network) as the input, your task is to develop a program (in
C++) to output the minimum number of connections that must be severed (removed) to ensure
no connectivity between the hacker’s computer and the central bank server.

INPUT:
You should read a name of a text file from the keyboard (standard input). This file contains
the graph (network). The first line of the text file contains two integers n and m.
n is the number of computers
m is the number of connections
Next m lines describe the connections. Each line contains two integers u and v, indicating that
there is a network connection between computer u and computer v. There is at most one
network connection between two computers. The hacker is using the computer 1 and the
central bank’s data server is represented by n.
OUTPUT:
Output a single integer X where X is the minimum number of connections that must be
removed to break all pathways between the hacker’s computer and the central bank’s server.
